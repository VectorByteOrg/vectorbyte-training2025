# Pre-work and set-up

## Hardware and Software

- We will be using [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/) for all data manipulation and analyses/model fitting. Any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) will do, as long as you have `R` (version 3.6 or higher) installed.

- You may use any IDE/ GUI for `R` (VScode, RStudio, Emacs, etc). For most people, [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a good option. Whichever one you decide to use, please make sure it is installed and tested before the workshop.

- We will also be using Slack for additional support during the training. Accepted students will receive an e-mail with joining information. We will have a channel on Slack dedicated to software/hardware issues and troubleshooting. 

- We also host all materials on [GitHub](https://github.com/), and we recommend that all students have a GitHub account. 

## Pre-requisites

We are assuming familiarity with `R` basics as well as at least introductory statistics, including up through simple linear regression. If you would like materials to review, we recommend that you do the following:

***Review of `R`***

1.  Go to [The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html), and read+work through the [Biological Computing in R Chapter](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/07-R.html).

2.  In addition / alternatively to pre-work element (1), here are some resources for brushing up on R [at the end of the Intro R Chapter you can try](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/07-R.html#readings-and-resources). There are many more resources online (e.g., [this](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r) and [this](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/learn-r-for-data-science/) ) -- pick something that suits your learning style.

<br>

***Review of statistics***

1.  Review background on [introductory probability and statistics](Stats_review.qmd) ([solutions to exercises](Stats_review_soln.qmd)). You can also use the resources on [The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist - Basic Data Analyses and Statistics](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/Stats-Intro.html) through into linear models.

2.  Review the conceptual basics of [Simple Linear Regression](VB_RegRev.qmd). We'll refresh fitting linear models in R as well as transformations and diagnostic plots during the workshop.
